## Single Responsibility Principle - SRP

A class should have one, and only one, reason to change. There should never be more than one reason for a class to change

**Definition**
Every module should have a clearly‑defined job

**Scopes of Responsibility**
principle can apply at multiple different levels.

### SRP Design

- identify "responsibilites" and "jobs"

- watch out for "reasons to change"

- Favor multiple small classes over fewr, more complex ones.

Examine your classes looking for individual responsibilities or jobs. 
In the original terms, you'd be *looking for reasons to change*. 
Each time you find one of these, 
<u>it's potentially another class that you could extract</u>.
